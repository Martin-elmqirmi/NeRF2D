# NeRF2D
Implementation of a 2D NeRF with mathematica and a visualization step by step of the process and the results.

## Step 1
Create 1D images using a very simple rendering process.

## Step 2
Generate samples along the rays of the cameras and associate them with the original color of the pixel.

## Step3
Train the network with the samples and the original images.

## Step4 
Evaluate using new camera positions and compare them with the real rendering of the scene.
